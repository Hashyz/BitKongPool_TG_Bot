# BitKongPool_TG_Bot

/start: This command initiates a conversation with your bot and displays a custom keyboard with options for checking the pool or leaderboard.

/pool [p] [hours]: Use this command to check the current pool or the pool from the past. Replace [hours] with the number of past hours you want to check, and add [p] to specify that you want to check the past pool. For example:

/pool: Check the current pool.
/pool p 3: Check the pool from the past 3 hours.
/leader [t] [total] [p] [time]: Use this command to check the leaderboard. You can specify the total number of people and, optionally, a past time period for the leaderboard. For example:

/leader: Check the leaderboard for the top 10.
/leader t 20: Check the leaderboard for the top 20.
/leader t 10 p 2: Check the leaderboard for the top 10 from the past 2 hours.

You can enter these commands in your Telegram chat with your bot to interact with it and get the desired information about the pool and leaderboard.
